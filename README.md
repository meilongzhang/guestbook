This is my case study. I use React for the frontend and Node/Express for backend, and SQLite3 for database.

How to Setup:

-   install node.js
-   go to client folder and run 'npm install'
-   go to server folder and run 'npm install'
-   go to root folder and run 'npm run dev' to launch both
-   navigate to server/db to view the database
